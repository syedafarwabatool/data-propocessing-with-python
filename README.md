The dataset is about life expectancy, which includes details about health, economy, and
environment. It has both numbers (like income levels) and categories (like country names). This dataset was chosen because it has a mix of real-world problems like missing data, outliers, and high dimensionality. Solving these challenges is essential for building good
machine learning models. Working on this dataset helped practice techniques used in real- world data preprocessing
